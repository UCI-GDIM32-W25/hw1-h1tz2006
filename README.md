# HW1
## W1L2 In-Class Activity

Put your notes from the W1L2 (Thurs, Jan 9) in-class activity here.

## Devlog
When developing HW1, the player movement part is one of the core functions. I implemented smooth movement logic through the PlayerController class,  I used Unity's Input.GetAxis() method to capture input on both the horizontal and vertical axes, allowing the player to achieve smooth movement through keyboard input. Additionally, to ensure natural movement, I incorporated the Transform.Translate method to update the player's position in real time based on input values. This implementation not only fit the initial plan but also allowed me to quickly locate and optimize the code through annotated guidelines, thus ensuring the integrity and stability of the movement functionality.

## Open-Source Assets

## Prof comments
This Devlog is missing the in-class activity, so I can't give you full points for it! Also, your Devlog doesn't quite seem to connect the plans to your code- I would like to see more details as to how the plan you laid out affected how you structured your code.

Also, you can remove the Devlog prompt text. This makes it easier for me to read your Devlog.
